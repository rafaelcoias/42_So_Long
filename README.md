# So_Long

## Assignment

This project is a very small 2D game.

You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was
developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images
and deal with keyboard and mouse events.

## Goal

Make you work with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

So long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management,
event handling, colors, textures, and so forth.

## What you need to know before starting so long

### Minilibx

The main thing you must understand in order to start doing so_long is <a href="https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx">Minilibx</a>.

MiniLibX is a tiny graphics library which allows you to do the most basic things for rendering something in screens without any knowledge of X-Window and Cocoa. It provides so-called simple window creation, a questionable drawing tool, half-ass image functions and a weird event management system.

See and start using minilibx with <a href="https://qst0.github.io/ft_libgfx/man_mlx.html">this</a> manual.
